E-Commerce Sales and Customer Prediction – Usage Guide

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and deep learning libraries. It focuses on forecasting sales trends and predicting customer purchasing behavior using RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Random Forest models.

First, ensure that Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended) is installed on your system. It is advisable to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Install the required libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow or PyTorch.

After installing the dependencies, navigate to the project folder containing the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file and launch Jupyter Notebook. Open the notebook from the browser interface.

Run all the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will load the dataset, preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, normalize values, and prepare time-series sequences for training.

The deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) will be trained on sequential sales data, while Random Forest will be used as a baseline model for comparison. The notebook will automatically evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

During execution, training progress, loss values, and prediction results will be displayed. Ensure that the dataset file is placed in the same directory as the notebook before running it.

The entire workflow, including preprocessing, model training, performance comparison, and result visualization, is fully contained within the notebook.
